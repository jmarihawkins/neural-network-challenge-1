# Student Loan Risk with Deep Learning

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to predict student loan repayment success using a neural network. Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure and function, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that can learn to recognize patterns in data. In this project, we utilize TensorFlow, a powerful open-source library for machine learning and artificial intelligence, along with Keras, a high-level API within TensorFlow, to build and train our neural network. The scripting language used for this project is Python, known for its simplicity and vast array of libraries, making it ideal for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Functionality

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - **Read and Review Data**: Load the data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and review its structure.
    - **Define Features and Target**: Identify the features (input variables) and the target (output variable) for the neural network.
    - **Split Data**: Divide the data into training and testing sets.
    - **Scale Data**: Use StandardScaler to normalize the feature data.

2. **Model Creation**:
    - **Sequential Model**: Initialize a Sequential model.
    - **Add Layers**: Add input, hidden, and output layers to the model. The hidden layers use the ReLU activation function, while the output layer uses the sigmoid activation function.
    - **Compile Model**: Compile the model using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - **Fit Model**: Train the model using the training data over 50 epochs.
    - **Evaluate Model**: Assess the model's performance using the test data and calculate loss and accuracy.

4. **Model Usage**:
    - **Save Model**: Save the trained model to a file.
    - **Load Model**: Reload the saved model for making predictions.
    - **Make Predictions**: Use the model to predict loan repayment success on the test data.
    - **Classification Report**: Generate a report showing the precision, recall, and F1-score of the modelâ€™s predictions.

## Summary
In summary, this project leverages neural networks to predict the likelihood of student loan repayment success. The process involves several key steps: data preparation, model creation, training, evaluation, and usage. The data is prepared by loading it into a DataFrame, defining features and targets, splitting into training and testing sets, and scaling the features. A Sequential model is then created with specific input, hidden, and output layers, compiled using appropriate loss functions and optimizers, and trained over multiple epochs. The trained model is evaluated for its performance, saved for future use, and loaded to make predictions on new data. 

**Real-World Applications**:
1. **Predictive Analytics for Portfolio Management**: Financial institutions can integrate this model into their portfolio management systems to continuously monitor and assess the risk levels of their student loan portfolios. By analyzing trends and predicting potential defaults, financial managers can proactively adjust their portfolios, reallocate resources, and implement risk mitigation strategies to enhance overall portfolio performance and stability.
2. **Government Policy and Educational Funding**: Governments and educational policymakers can use this model to design and implement more effective student loan programs. By understanding the factors influencing loan repayment success, policymakers can tailor loan conditions, such as interest rates and repayment schedules, to improve repayment rates and reduce default rates. Additionally, this model can help identify at-risk student populations, enabling targeted interventions and support programs to enhance educational outcomes and financial stability for students.

The recommendation system aspect involves gathering relevant academic, financial, and demographic data to make informed loan recommendations using content-based filtering, ensuring privacy, fairness, and accuracy in the process. This approach can significantly enhance the decision-making process for students seeking financial aid, leading to more effective and personalized loan solutions.
